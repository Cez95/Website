					My name is Christopher Olson and I am recent graduate of the University of New Hampshire. I will be attending graduate school in the fall to obtain my MBA with a focus in information systems. I have a strong passion for web/application development. I currently know html5/css3/JavaScript the best. When I obtain my MBA I plan on working in the tech. industry. My goal is to start my on software company in the near future. Although I have been lucky to find my passion in computer programming it took a lot of failure to get here.  <br><br>
As a freshman I was an Athletic Training major. I chose Athletic Training because I was fascinated with working out and I wanted to help people. This was not the case. I learned Athletic Training had nothing to do with working out or training clients. Although it was not the right avenue for me, I went on to personal train in my free time and even competed in a physique competition. As a freshman I also pledged Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. This was a great experience because it opened a huge network of friends I still remain in contact with. <br><br>

During my sophomore year, I decided to go into business. After already taking a full year of athletic training courses, transferring into the Business school was a lofty task. The only way I could switch into business and still graduate on time was if I dropped all my athletic training courses. My advisor recommended that I didn’t proceed with my plan. Despite his recommendation, I knew what the best decision was for me. My academic performance that year granted me acceptance into the Business school.<br><br>

I found my passion for computer programming as a senior. My roommate asked me if I would help him with the business side of producing an IOS app. I said yes and before long, I grew tired of not being able to contribute to the development of our product. This led me to begin learning programming. Although I am far from an expert my skills grow exponentially each day. I plan of continuing this skill for the rest of my life and hope one day it opens a door of opportunity if it hasn’t already.
