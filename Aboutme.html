					My name is Christopher Olson and I am an MBA student MBA with a focus in information systems at the University of New Hampshire. I have a strong passion for application development. I currently know Swift3, Python and Firebase really well, however, I have experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Objective C, and Java. When I obtain my MBA, I hope to work in the tech. industry. My long-term goal is to start my own software company. <br><br>

As a college freshman, I was an Athletic Training major. I chose Athletic Training because I was fascinated with the human body and I really wanted to help people. Unfortunately, it was not the right avenue for me. I realized that there was more that I could do to help people with my work. After working hard to bring up my grades, I was accepted into the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics at the University of New Hampshire. This was a fantastic experience because I learned an incredible amount about entrepreneurship and became exposed to people who have become close friends. <br><br>  

My hobbies include mountain biking, surfing, working out, watching movies, and playing video games. When I was a freshman in college I also pledged Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. This was a great experience because it opened a huge network of close friends I still remain in contact with. I have also competed in a physique competition which I had been training towards for over a year. <br><br>

Currently I am balancing a full-time MBA schedule while developing an iOS application that I have been working on for the past two months. I love learning new things and I plan to hone my development skills for the rest of my life.
